# HealthPH+ language detection

Copy this entire folder to give developers a local HTTP API and reusable Python
module. It reproduces the language detection in `notebooks/preproccessor.ipynb`.
No research datasets or disease model are required.

## Setup and run

From inside `language-detection-service/`:

```sh
python3.14 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements-inference.txt
python -m healthph_language.api
```

The pinned runtime was tested on Python 3.14.6, macOS arm64, CPU. FastText includes
a native extension; installing from source requires a C++ compiler (on macOS,
Xcode Command Line Tools). Other platforms require their own installation check.

Base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8001`. Interactive API docs: `http://127.0.0.1:8001/docs`.
Use `--port 8002` or `--host` to configure the server.

### Models and keywords

Include `models/lid.176.bin` (about 125 MB), `models/lid.176.ftz` (about 916 KB),
and both CSV files in `keywords/` when sharing. Model binaries are ignored by Git:
a code-only clone requires copying them from the repository's original `models/`
directory or the developer handoff. Exclude virtual environments and test caches.

The detector prefers `.bin` and uses `.ftz` only when `.bin` is absent. Set
`HEALTHPH_LANGUAGE_MODEL_PATH` to select a model explicitly. In Python,
`LanguageDetector(model_path="/absolute/path/lid.176.ftz")` overrides that setting;
`keyword_dir=` selects another keyword directory. Bundled paths are resolved
relative to the module. No assets are downloaded automatically. A missing explicit
model, corrupt selected model, or missing/empty keyword list fails startup with an
asset error. A corrupt `.bin` does not silently fall back to `.ftz`.

## HTTP API

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:8001/v1/language/predict \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"text":"I am feeling better today."}'
```

| Endpoint | Request / result |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /v1/language/predict` | `{"text":"..."}` → one prediction |
| `POST /v1/language/predict-batch` | `{"texts":["...","..."]}` → `{"results":[...]}` in input order |
| `GET /health/live` | `{"status":"ok"}` |
| `GET /health/ready` | Ready status and the loaded model filename after a successful inference warmup |

Every prediction contains:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `language` | Final language code after keyword overrides |
| `cleaned_text` | Text passed to FastText |
| `is_supported` | Whether the final code is one of `en`, `fil`, `ceb`, `ilo`, `hil` |
| `prediction_source` | `fasttext` or `keyword_override` |
| `fasttext_language` | Original top FastText language code |
| `fasttext_confidence` | Score for **fasttext_language**, even when overridden; clamped to [0, 1] for numerical rounding |

Send original raw posts. The cleaner preserves the notebook's exact rules:
double HTML decoding, removal of links, mentions, hashtags, and non-ASCII
characters, whitespace normalization, and lowercasing. Curated complete words or
phrases are matched against **original text**, case-insensitively with flexible
whitespace. Hiligaynon wins if both keyword lists match. These inherited rules
include broad words such as `ubo`; they are heuristics, and an override has no
separate confidence score. There is no minimum model confidence threshold.

Unsupported languages are returned with `is_supported: false`; callers decide whether to filter them. FastText `tl` predictions are normalized to `fil` in `language`, while `fasttext_language` retains the original model label. The compact model may produce different predictions from `.bin`.

HTTP requests accept at most 10,000 characters per text and 1–32 texts per batch.
Blank, non-string, or text with no ASCII letters after cleaning is invalid
(including emoji-only, URL-only, and non-ASCII-only input). Invalid input rejects
the entire batch with HTTP `422`. HTTP `503` means the detector is not ready;
HTTP `500` means inference failed. Asset failures prevent server startup.

## Python usage

Run from this folder, or add its absolute path to `PYTHONPATH` in another project:

```python
from healthph_language import LanguageDetector, normalize_text

detector = LanguageDetector()  # Create once and reuse.
result = detector.predict("RT @person: I am feeling better today. https://example.com")
results = detector.predict_many(["may ubo ako", "sakit ti barukong"])
print(result["language"], result["cleaned_text"])
```

Python calls raise `ValueError` for invalid inputs. For offline notebook use,
`predict_many` accepts any list length (an empty list returns `[]`), processes
32 texts at a time, and has no text-length cap. All texts are validated before
inference. `normalize_text` accepts strings and does not validate the result;
the notebook adapts pandas missing values before calling it.

## JavaScript usage

Use Node.js 24. Copy `examples/language-client.mjs` into your backend or import it
from this folder:

```js
import { createLanguageClient } from './examples/language-client.mjs';

const client = createLanguageClient();
try {
  const result = await client.predict('may ubo ako');
  const { results } = await client.predictBatch(['sakit ti barukong', 'feeling okay']);
  console.log(result.language, results);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error.code, error.status, error.message);
}
```

Set `HEALTHPH_LANGUAGE_URL` or pass `serviceUrl` to change the URL. The default
timeout is 30 seconds; set `timeoutMs` to override it. Client error codes are
`HTTP_ERROR`, `TIMEOUT`, `CONNECTION_ERROR`, and `INVALID_RESPONSE`. Requests are
not retried. To try the client: `node examples/language-client.mjs 'may ubo ako'`.

## Tests

```sh
python -m pip install -r requirements-test.txt
python -m pytest
python -m pytest --run-model
node --test tests/language-client.test.mjs
```

The model suite compares predictions and cleaning to a frozen notebook reference,
checks both model formats, and exercises a copied service outside the repository.
To also check the JavaScript client against a running service:

```sh
HEALTHPH_TEST_REAL_SERVICE=1 node --test tests/language-client.test.mjs
```
